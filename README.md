 I completed an advent of code to completion a few years ago (https://ferd.ca/advent-of-code-2017.html) and ragequit 2019 after it’d take me way too much time when it got to some obscure project euler sort of requirements (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxzF1KghD_aMb-n_aZnj5oZ5KVMX8WKRB), and
I caught it on video.

Both were done in Erlang, so this year I’m gonna set a low bar and try to go as far as I can with just Awk, for the sake of it, and quit when it gets too annoying or I get bored.
